digital-world repository with charming charnant Unicode tools - cool chardcore

You can use any part of this code in your projects if you wish. Popularize cool Unicode idea if you like it, so that we can all enjoy it.

Unicode & UNIVERSAL A=1, B=2,C=3	Z=26, 0=0, 1=1,		encodings are popular in digitall worLd, and digitall world is valuable only when it's filled with wise content.

Colors:
0 - white
1 - black
2 - orange
3 - yellow
4 - green
5 - red
6 - pink, rose
7 - violet, lila
8 - brown
9 - blue

+ morse codes, hand alphabet

Smart watch++ example: 1303 -> 1263 and so on up to 99.

Have fun

Okey, naturally the code uses fonts from your system. Fonts can have more or less characters - if necessary install new fonts.

watch-Binary with the "Binarish Language" converter. The most popular encodings are Morse codes, 8-bit encodings, music. Although lot of popular codes, especially in music are longer than 8-bit. People often like to write it with space and then use codes longer than 8-bits. Often codes are sent with simpler communication channels.

No necessity to send the leading zeros in the 8-bit encodings if you have the third state like silence, pause, sending zeros for a long time etc - then you can easily complete, complement with the leading zeros. 11 instead of 00000011.

8-bit code examples:
0=0
1=1
10=2
11=3
100=4
101=5
...
110000=48=0
...
111001=57=9
...
1000001=65=A
...
1100001=97=a
...
9000, the keyboard icon, would be longer than 8-bits:
10001100101000
16-bit encodings cover whole FFFF-Unicode, 0-65535.
8-bit encodings cover 0-255.

//In the code indices are interchanged i<->j equally everywhere.
//The most popular ij standard convention in Science, Mathematics, C
//(C convention different from Fortran convention etc)
//anyway: Science, Mathematics, C would be
//i=0..intRows
//j=0..intCols
//i - up down
//j - left right
//index(i,j)=i*intCols+j
//(ij different than xy in carthesian coordinate system)
//^y,i
//|
//|
//-->x,j
